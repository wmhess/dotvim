This is a back to basics setup that I want to hone and use on the Windows VM.

For the most part I want to try to avoid using any plugins. Just keep it
simple. The idea is that I'm probably not going to use Neovim on a VM, so
I want some decent settings for vim.

I grabbed the initial vimrc from github here: https://gist.github.com/simonista/8703722

Slowly turing off some of the annoying things and adding my own changes.
